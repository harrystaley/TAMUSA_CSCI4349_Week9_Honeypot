# TAMUSA_CSCI4349_Week9_Honeypot

## Project Overview

This repository is a part of the CSCI4349 Week 9 penetration testing course at Texas A&M University-San Antonio. The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide for deploying a honeypot using Vagrant and Google Cloud. A honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or study attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. This guide includes instructions for configuring a virtual machine and setting up necessary firewall rules to simulate and analyze network attacks.

## Setup and Installation

**Dependencies**:
- Vagrant
- Google Cloud SDK

**Steps**:
1. Install the latest version of Vagrant and Google Cloud SDK on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory.
4. Execute the Vagrantfile using the command `vagrant up`.
5. Follow the instructions provided in the guide to configure your Google Cloud account and setup the virtual machine.
6. Setup the necessary firewall rules as per the instructions in the guide.

## Usage Examples

Once the honeypot is set up, it can be used to simulate network attacks for educational purposes. The following are a few examples of how you can use this setup:

- Test the effectiveness of your network security measures.
- Analyze the behavior of attackers and develop strategies to counter them.
- Study different types of network attacks and their impact.
